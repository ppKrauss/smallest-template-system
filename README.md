smallest-template-system


This project is a didactic investigation about the simplest ways to express *template systems* and "template engine" algorithms, and about improved versions of these algorithms for practical use, that we named the "smallest" ones.

The simplest and well-known template is that: "_Hello *X*!_" where *X* is a placeholder, that you can substitute by "world" or by "Mary" to produce "_Hello world!_" or "_Hello Mary!_".

See *how the smallest is inspired by the simplest*:
  * [SimplestSyntax simplest template syntax] and 
  * [SimplestAlgorithm Simplest template engine algorithms]

For see the *smallest algorithms*, choose your preferred programming language:
  * [PHP PHP] (and download available)
  * [Javascript Javascript]
  * [PLpgSql PL/pgSQL] (PostgreSQL stored procedures language)

See [habemus-papam project](https://github.com/ppKrauss/habemus-papam) for a good test-kit and bentchmark reference.

NOTE: there are two main scales of use, under construction at downloads,
  * _string scale_: functions with a `sprintf` functionality (more similar to [Python string templates](http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#formatspec))
  * _document scale_: simple MVC frameworks.
