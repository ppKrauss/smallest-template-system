I started to work with the _smallest-template-system project_ because I need to train my programmers and designers,
need introduce the template system problems and solutions.

With a small implementation, like _smallest-template-system_, they can see concepts,
test their ideas, and work with solutions, without spending a lot of development time.

They work for my customers: customers not have all the same template system, and there
is a great diversity of template systems (!!).

With the  <tt>sprintf</tt> standarization on TemplateSyntax  I tried to unify concepts (see introduction); and,
when customer permits, I can try to unify implementations by our standars (XSLT or PHP-templates,
and sprintf formatters).
